        This visualization shows (from a sample of 69 users) the frequency with which they
        aggregately either follow other blogs, like, or comment on someones post on an hourly basis.

        <h2>Justification</h2>
        <p>
            I chose this data set because I thought it would be interesting to observe
            users' behavior overtime when following of like social media sources. This
            specific data set is only blog data and from that only a sample of 69 users.
            I would have liked to get a bigger sample or one from a more prevelent social
            media platform, but I couldn't find one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first encoding I want to talk about was the color because I had no other
            intention for it than to make the visualization pleasant to look at. The visualization
            has a timescale for the x axis (because points needed to be plotted in time)and a
            linear one for the y. I chose to use a scatterplot so that users could easily see where
            the different points were. I made them opaque so that it would be apparent when the
            points were overlapping. I also include hover behavior on the points to users could
            see the exact data for any point. I made a line as well because I at times the plots are very
            close together so the lines helped to show the relationship/slope between points easier
            to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had two different types of controling elements. The first was buttons.
            The input buttons allowed the user to see either the following or liking
            behavior of other users over the course of about a week. They might even
            be able to tell the bahavior over a certain day but it would be kind of difficult
            since the data points are bunched together. This is where the date slider comes in
            handy. The date slider allows the user to see a more specific range of data so they
            can observe user behaviors more clearly on specifc days or time range.
